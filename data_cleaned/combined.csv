2013-74,Project Information Literacy: What Can Be Learned about the Information-Seeking Behavior of Today’s College Students?,invited paper,Project Information Literacy,,,,,,,,2013,2013-74,"What is it like to be a college student in the digital age? Since 2008, as part of our ongoing study at Project Information Literacy (PIL), we have surveyed more than 10,000 students at over 40 colleges and universities in the US. We have investigated how college students find information and conduct research—their needs, strategies, and workarounds—for solving information problems that occur during course-related research and in their everyday lives. We have found the large majority of students we have studied across all types of higher-education institutions still attend college to learn, but many are lost in a thicket of information overload.

2021-89,Closing Keynote,Keynote,"Data Editor, The Guardian",,,,,,,,2021,2021-89,"Mona Chalabi is a journalist who really loves numbers. She is the Data Editor of The Guardian where she writes articles, produces documentaries, and illustrates, as well as animates, data. After analyzing statistics for the United Nations, Chalabi saw how important data was, but also how easily it could be used by people with their own specific agendas. Since then, her work for organizations like Transparency International and The Guardian has had one goal: to make sure as many people as possible can find and question the data they need to make informed decisions about their lives. She gives speeches and teaches courses on data journalism, and when she can, she illustrates data. Her illustrations have been exhibited by the Design Museum and were commended by the Royal Statistical Society, of which they said, “Her deceptively simple graphs are fun and accessible.” Mona helped create the Emmy-nominated four-part video series “Vagina Dispatches” which explores the physical, social, and sometimes political dynamics that surround women’s bodies. She also executive produced and hosted Strange Bird, a podcast about things that we’re not great at talking about. Chalabi holds a master’s degree in International Security from the Paris Institute of Political Studies and has worked for FiveThirtyEight, the Banks of England, the Economist Intelligence Unit, and the International Organization for Migration.","mona chalabi is a journalist who really loves numbers. she is the data editor of the guardian where she writes articles, produces documentaries, and illustrates, as well as animates, data. after analyzing statistics for the united nations, chalabi saw how important data was, but also how easily it could be used by people with their own specific agendas. since then, her work for organizations like transparency international and the guardian has had one goal: to make sure as many people as possible can find and question the data they need to make informed decisions about their lives. she gives speeches and teaches courses on data journalism, and when she can, she illustrates data. her illustrations have been exhibited by the design museum and were commended by the royal statistical society, of which they said, “her deceptively simple graphs are fun and accessible.” mona helped create the emmy-nominated four-part video series “vagina dispatches” which explores the physical, social, and sometimes political dynamics that surround women’s bodies. she also executive produced and hosted strange bird, a podcast about things that we’re not great at talking about. chalabi holds a master’s degree in international security from the paris institute of political studies and has worked for fivethirtyeight, the banks of england, the economist intelligence unit, and the international organization for migration.",,Live ,,,,No tag,No tag,

The secret to their success? Lateral reading. Mike Caulfield describes lateral reading as reading “across many connected sites instead of digging deep into the site at hand” (2017, ch. 16). This is in contrast to “vertical reading,” which focuses on a single source and lends itself well to acronym-based evaluation frameworks like CRAAP but doesn’t require readers to leave the site to learn more about it from other perspectives. This interactive session will provide background and context about lateral reading before spending the bulk of the webcast demonstrating lateral reading activities she has used with various audiences. Participants will leave the session with an understanding of lateral reading as a concept and with ideas for how to teach lateral reading skills in a variety of contexts.

This presentation describes how active learning principles and techniques were applied in synchronous one-shot sessions with Zoom. First, essential elements of the in-person class were identified. Equivalent online learning objects and tools that could be used in the virtual classroom were selected. Second, because much of the learning took place in small groups with students interacting together, work was done to enhance breakout room experiences. In particular, a concerted effort was taken to methodically allow students to work together on research with the librarian still available to the whole class. Finally, a student survey was distributed within the LMS to determine if the approach taken was engaging and useful. Overall, the poster session brings to light what successes came with this approach and plans to improve upon it.

This tool uses a widget approach, which allows librarians to independently develop smaller reusable sections of code that can be instantly applied and updated across multiple guides. Through search widgets, RSS feeds, instant messaging, and resource tagging, these guides use the Web’s social technologies to make them interactive. This technology also makes guide creation less time consuming, because librarians can reuse materials that their colleagues have created. By combining resources, librarians can produce customized guides for subjects, courses, and even individuals without expending a great deal of development time. While each guide can be unique, they allow us to draw upon a central repository of skills and abilities available to all librarians.

As a result, a collaboration was formed between the University Libraries and Information Technology Services in order to select, test, and make recommendations about the application of mobile devices for roving reference. This collaborative group formulated a project scope and use case scenarios for how the devices could be used, e.g., conducting a reference interview away from a desk and delivering resources to a patron via e-mail. From the use case scenarios, technicians extracted device requirements and matched those requirements to devices that were on the market, securing four devices for testing. Next, the devices were tested and evaluated by library faculty, staﬀ, and student employees and recommendations about the devices were made. Although there wasn’t a clear winner of the devices tested, this pilot project served two major goals: 1) to test these devices in a library setting and discover the beneﬁts and drawbacks and 2) to create a selection and testing process that can be used to evaluate new technologies.

2019-457,"The Evolution of Student Resource-Use: A 17-Year Citation
Analysis Project",poster, Brigham Young University,,,,,,,assessment,2019,2019-457,"While citation analyses often demonstrate how student resource-use reacts to an intervention or evolves in a cohort, relatively few studies explore how student source-use has evolved over a larger time frame. This study compiles freshman research papers spanning sixteen years and categorizes the cited items employed in sample writing. The study finds that books are used less as time goes on. Meanwhile, academic articles appear with increasing frequency. Ultimately, I argue that allowing student research to rely too heavily on academic articles, which are often inaccessible after graduation, may cripple these students' post-graduation information literacy practices.","while citation analyses often demonstrate how student resource-use reacts to an intervention or evolves in a cohort, relatively few studies explore how student source-use has evolved over a larger time frame. this study compiles freshman research papers spanning sixteen years and categorizes the cited items employed in sample writing. the study finds that books are used less as time goes on. meanwhile, academic articles appear with increasing frequency. ultimately, i argue that allowing student research to rely too heavily on academic articles, which are often inaccessible after graduation, may cripple these students' post-graduation information literacy practices.",,,,,,,,

Variety is ubiquitous and expected. Likewise, academic libraries are also providing users with an array of choices: different sources, formats, search tools, and even study spaces and service points. Research has found, paradoxically, that more choice often leads to less satisfaction. Libraries have introduced various filters (relevance algorithms, advanced search forms, format limiters, etc.) to help users navigate the abundance of choices being presented to them. By filters we mean mechanisms for narrowing, customizing, or even expanding options, depending on the parameters of the need at hand. Filters are also implemented behind the scenes (approval plans, short-term loans, etc.) to help streamline library workflow and productivity. This paper presents the results of a mixed-methods study aimed at gaining a better understanding of the impact of “filters” on library workflows, collections, services, and users. We will explore the potential for automated filters to have unintended consequences and will present recommendations for how filters might be adapted and harnessed to enhance the overall library user experience.","choices abound in all aspects of life, from where we shop, to what we shop for, to how we obtain and consume media, food, and information. variety is ubiquitous and expected. likewise, academic libraries are also providing users with an array of choices: different sources, formats, search tools, and even study spaces and service points. research has found, paradoxically, that more choice often leads to less satisfaction. libraries have introduced various filters (relevance algorithms, advanced search forms, format limiters, etc.) to help users navigate the abundance of choices being presented to them. by filters we mean mechanisms for narrowing, customizing, or even expanding options, depending on the parameters of the need at hand. filters are also implemented behind the scenes (approval plans, short-term loans, etc.) to help streamline library workflow and productivity. this paper presents the results of a mixed-methods study aimed at gaining a better understanding of the impact of “filters” on library workflows, collections, services, and users. we will explore the potential for automated filters to have unintended consequences and will present recommendations for how filters might be adapted and harnessed to enhance the overall library user experience.",,,,,,,,
